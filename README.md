# ML Algorithms from Scratch  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains implementations of various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms from scratch using Python. The goal is to understand the inner workings of these algorithms by building them without relying on high-level libraries like Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow.  


## 📌 Implemented Algorithms  
- Clustering:  
  - Kmeans 

- Classification:  
  - Random Forest 
  - Decision Tree (included in Random Forest) 

## 📊 Future Work  
- Implement more ML algorithms   
- Optimize existing implementations for better efficiency
