# ML Algorithms from Scratch  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains implementations of various Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms and architectures from scratch using Python. The goal is to understand the inner workings of these algorithms and build solid understanding of these architectures.  For some algorithms, I have implemented the end to end training pipeline along with the evaluation.


## 📌 Implemented Algorithms  
- Clustering:  
  - Kmeans Clustering

- Classification:  
  - Random Forest 
  - Decision Trees (included in Random Forest) 

- Computer Vision
  - [Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929)
  - [NaViT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06304)
  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385)

## 📊 Future Work  
- Implement more ML algorithms   
- Optimize existing implementations for better efficiency
